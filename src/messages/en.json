    "content": "Hi, I'm Enrico, since I was a child, I've spent a lot of time tinkering with computers, you know, the classic nerd :)<br />I find it fascinating to try to understand how things work, rebuild them, and experiment with them.<br />I discovered programming in high school and was fascinated by how it was possible to imagine anything in that small universe where we start counting from 0. And here we are :)<br />I believe I still have to find my path, but for the moment, I work as a web developer.<br />My second great passion is music; I've been playing the piano since I was a child.<br />I like board games, pizza, and bla bla bla.<br />If we get to know each other, we'll have the opportunity to talk about it.<br />Grateful for your visit; see ya! :)"
